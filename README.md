# TransferList

University at Buffalo Men's Basketball Team data collection

Every year the team recruits college players eligible to transfer. The coach routinely recieves lists of players possibly eligible to transfer in PDF form. This project simply reads these files and writes eligible players ("YES" in "eligible" column)  with their stats to a CSV file, in order to automate an otherwise lengthy process.
